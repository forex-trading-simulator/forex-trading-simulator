    <h2>Forex Trading..?</h2>
    <p>Forex, or foreign exchange, trading is an international market for buying and selling currencies. It is similar to the stock exchange, where you trade shares of a company. Like the stock market, you don't need to take possession of the currency to trade. Investors use forex trading to profit from the changing values of currencies based on their exchange rates. In fact, the foreign exchange market is what sets the value of floating exchange rates.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How It Works?</h2>
    <p>All currency trades are done in pairs. You sell your currency to buy another one. Every traveler who has gotten foreign currency has done forex trading. For example, when you go on vacation to Europe, you exchange dollars for euros at the going rate. You are selling U.S. dollars and buying euros. When you come back, you exchange your euros back into dollars. You are selling euros and buying U.S. dollars.

      The most familiar type of forex trading is spot trading. It's a simple purchase of one currency using another currency. You usually receive the foreign currency immediately. It's similar to exchanging currency for a trip. It's a contract between the trader and the market maker, or dealer. The trader buys a particular currency at the buy price from the market maker and sells a different currency at the selling price. The buy price is somewhat higher than the selling price. The difference between the two is called the “spread.” This is the transaction cost to the trader, which in turn is the profit earned by the market maker.
      
      You paid this spread without realizing it when you exchanged your dollars for euros. You would notice it if you made the transaction, canceled your trip and then tried to exchange the euros back to dollars right away. You wouldn't get the same amount of dollars back.</p>
